This is a C++ project created from scratch, planned to contain a series of general-purpose and specialized library components.

This project needs to support multiple operating systems and compilers, and adopt the latest C++ standard. CMake is planned as the basic tool for build scripts, with support for generating project files commonly used on specific platforms.

The specific support matrix is as follows:

| OS | Arch | Compiler | Build Tool | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | x86_64, arm64 | MSVC, Clang | Visual Studio, Ninja | |
| Linux | x86_64, arm64 | GCC, Clang | Make, Ninja | |
| macOS | x86_64, arm64, universal | Clang | Xcode, Ninja | |
| iOS | arm64 | Clang | Xcode, Ninja? | |
| Android | arm64 | Clang | Android Studio, Ninja | Requires NDK |
| WebAssembly | nodejs, browser | Clang | Make, Ninja | Requires EMSDK |

Among these, Linux, Android, and WebAssembly should support Docker builds. Project code and build directories should be mapped into Docker containers, and ensure that the project is not built as root user inside the container. Additionally, support mapping private keys and other sensitive files stored in the host environment to appropriate directories within Docker. Create Dockerfiles that meet the above requirements, or reference existing Docker images that meet the requirements. Create helper scripts to simplify operations.

## Build Configuration and Development Environment Requirements

- Code will adopt the C++23 standard
- Enable as many checking options as possible to report non-standard compliant code
- Enable clang-tidy and clang-format
- Support multiple build types such as Debug, Release, but all builds should generate separated debug symbol files
- Support FastDebug build type, which is the same as Debug but with O1 optimization level
- Support SlowRelease build type, which is the same as Release but with O0 optimization level
- Enable C++ modules

## Build Parameter Requirements

- Ability to enable various Sanitizers, including but not limited to Memory and Address. Default: OFF
- Allow stripping symbols from generated shared libraries. Default: OFF
- Support distributed compilation. Default: OFF

## Specific Build Targets

- Doc: Generate Doxygen documentation. Default: only enabled in Linux Docker environment. Can be enabled when Doxygen program exists on other OSes
- Support local install

## Third-party Libraries

- This project will reference a few third-party libraries, including but not limited to Boost, Zlib, SQLite, etc.
- Experimentally introduce certain libraries from GitHub
- To support multiple platforms, third-party libraries may need to be patched. Need to properly organize and manage these patch files
- Choose an appropriate package manager or use CMake directly

## Testing

- Distinguish between unit tests, regression tests, and Fuzz tests. Also include benchmark tests and stress tests
- Running unit tests should be a post-build step
- Regression tests and Fuzz tests should be separated from other test code
- Generate code coverage reports

## Other Build Configuration

- Create VSCode configuration support
- Create GitHub Actions configuration and scripts
- Generate static code analysis reports
- Generate project analysis reports
  - Generate project dependency graphs
  - Code quality analysis reports

## Notes

- macOS and iOS should properly handle signing and packaging issues. Android also needs to consider signing and packaging
- The build system should support GitHub Actions
  - Appropriately consider other environments, such as Jenkins, Azure, etc.


## AI Prompt Sequence

```
Please read the @README.md file and initialize this project based on its content.
```

```
To better utilize C++ new features, the compiler versions I plan to support are as follows:
clang >= 19.1
gcc >= 15.2
msvc >= 19.42
These versions officially support C++ module features. Adjust the compilation configuration files based on the above information, especially @CppModules.cmake.
```

```
I've changed my mind. This project will be temporarily called apt-template instead of ape2. I plan to confirm it works properly first, which requires extensive testing and validation. Such a well-developed template project can be reused, saving effort.
```

// Due to renaming causing build errors, it took 6 rounds of dialogue to fix. During this process, there were two instances where the AI was clearly stuck in incorrect thinking. After explaining where the error was, we were able to continue.

```
Please create a git commit for this work and push to GitHub.
```

```
I think I already gave you a GitHub access token. Can you create a repository on GitHub for me and then push the code?
```

```
I've already created an empty repository on GitHub at `git@github.com:xbigo/ape-template.git`. Please push to this repository.
```

```
You seem to have overwritten my original @README.md file content. Can you recover it and put it in a backup file?
```

```
In today's entire work session, my first instruction to you was to generate the entire project based on @README.md. At that time, this readme file was not saved to git, which was my mistake. Perhaps you can check your work logs to see if they contain the original content of this @README.md.
```

```
Except for my original readme, generate English versions for all other files containing Chinese, and use the English versions as the primary files.
```

```
Please create English versions for @README.md and @README.original.md as the primary files. Add the author's disclaimer in the @README.md file and a link to @README.original.md.
```

```
The Chinese version of the readme file is also needed. Why is it gone?
```

```
I found quite a few spelling errors and grammar issues in @README.original.zh.md. Please help me correct them, but don't rewrite the original text extensively.
```

```
I've added some content to the @README.original.zh.md file. Please translate and sync it to @README.original.md.
```
