This is a C++ project created from scratch, planned to contain a series of general-purpose and specialized library components.

This project needs to support multiple operating systems and compilers, and adopt the latest C++ standard. CMake is planned as the basic tool for build scripts, with support for generating project files commonly used on specific platforms.

The specific support matrix is as follows:

| OS | Arch | Compiler | Build Tool | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | x86_64, arm64 | MSVC, Clang | Visual Studio, Ninja | |
| Linux | x86_64, arm64 | GCC, Clang | Make, Ninja | |
| macOS | x86_64, arm64, universal | Clang | Xcode, Ninja | |
| iOS | arm64 | Clang | Xcode, Ninja? | |
| Android | arm64 | Clang | Android Studio, Ninja | Requires NDK |
| WebAssembly | nodejs, browser | Clang | Make, Ninja | Requires EMSDK |

Among these, Linux, Android, and WebAssembly should support Docker builds. Project code and build directories should be mapped into Docker containers, and ensure that the project is not built as root user inside the container. Additionally, support mapping private keys and other sensitive files stored in the host environment to appropriate directories within Docker. Create Dockerfiles that meet the above requirements, or reference existing Docker images that meet the requirements. Create helper scripts to simplify operations.

## Build Configuration and Development Environment Requirements

- Code will adopt the C++23 standard
- Enable as many checking options as possible to report non-standard compliant code
- Enable clang-tidy and clang-format
- Support multiple build types such as Debug, Release, but all builds should generate separated debug symbol files
- Support FastDebug build type, which is the same as Debug but with O1 optimization level
- Support SlowRelease build type, which is the same as Release but with O0 optimization level
- Enable C++ modules

## Build Parameter Requirements

- Ability to enable various Sanitizers, including but not limited to Memory and Address. Default: OFF
- Allow stripping symbols from generated shared libraries. Default: OFF
- Support distributed compilation. Default: OFF

## Specific Build Targets

- Doc: Generate Doxygen documentation. Default: only enabled in Linux Docker environment. Can be enabled when Doxygen program exists on other OSes
- Support local install

## Third-party Libraries

- This project will reference a few third-party libraries, including but not limited to Boost, Zlib, SQLite, etc.
- Experimentally introduce certain libraries from GitHub
- To support multiple platforms, third-party libraries may need to be patched. Need to properly organize and manage these patch files
- Choose an appropriate package manager or use CMake directly

## Testing

- Distinguish between unit tests, regression tests, and Fuzz tests. Also include benchmark tests and stress tests
- Running unit tests should be a post-build step
- Regression tests and Fuzz tests should be separated from other test code
- Generate code coverage reports

## Other Build Configuration

- Create VSCode configuration support
- Create GitHub Actions configuration and scripts
- Generate static code analysis reports
- Generate project analysis reports
  - Generate project dependency graphs
  - Code quality analysis reports

## Notes

- macOS and iOS should properly handle signing and packaging issues. Android also needs to consider signing and packaging
- The build system should support GitHub Actions
  - Appropriately consider other environments, such as Jenkins, Azure, etc.
